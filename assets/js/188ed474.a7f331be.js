There are two main factors at play here."),(0,o.kt)("p",null,"First, a cache is only a copy of some true data. The actual data is stored in some primary data store, likely one that has durability, transactionality, and other functionality that a cache doesn't support. The cache is optimized for fast reads and removes unnecessary features in support of this goal."),(0,o.kt)("p",null,"The problem here is that you now have two sources of data -- the primary and the cached -- and something is responsible for keeping them in sync. This requires a deep understanding of your application requirements and a tight integration between your read and write paths to ensure a satisfactory outcome to your end users."),(0,o.kt)("p",null,"The second problem is in the tradeoff between cache availability and cache hit rate. Caches use memory to store data for quick retrieval, and RAM is more expensive than disk. Rather than store your entire data set in your cache, you want to only store data that is likely to be accessed again in the near future."),(0,o.kt)("p",null,"This tradeoff is even more important in the world of static, instance-based caches. You need to pre-provision your cache size ahead of time, and you'll pay for that cache size being available regardless of whether you use it or not. Further, if your cache runs out of room, you'll need to rely on an eviction mechanism to eject entries from your cache. If you're not careful about cache management and eviction, this can make a problem go from bad to worse as you get a spike in evictions and increased load on your primary data sources."),(0,o.kt)("p",null,"With Momento, this problem is diminished. Momento is a dynamic cache that doesn't require pre-provisioning a specific cache size. You only need to specify the TTL value for a particular cache entry, and Momento will ensure it is available until the expiry."),(0,o.kt)("p",null,"This greatly reduces the number of factors you need to consider in caching.

This makes it much easier to tune your TTL in a way that makes sense to you and your users."),(0,o.kt)("p",null,"Now that we know about cache freshness and the difficulties of cache invalidation, let's go ahead and update our application code to use a write-aside strategy as well."),(0,o.kt)("h2",{id:"implementing-a-write-aside-caching-strategy"},"Implementing a write-aside caching strategy"),(0,o.kt)("p",null,"Let's go back and implement write-aside caching in our serverless application.
