Practically, this could mean you provision for specific functional capacity (such as DynamoDB's read and write capacity throughput) rather than the underlying resources (such as a database instance size with various configurations of CPU, RAM, and network I/O).

It can also mean a system that allows for flexible scale up and scale down, such as Amazon DynamoDB or Amazon Kinesis.
